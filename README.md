# Prediction-Forecasting-of-US-Covid-19-Dataset
Assign Dataset to df & first step is to clean the Dataset & applied EDA to the dataset.
# First We have done Univariate Analysis:
  1) Count of Cases, Month Year
  2) Count of states
# Bivariate Analysis:
  1) Cases against County
  2) Cases against States
  3) Deaths against Couunty
  4) Deaths against States
  5) Cases Found against each Day, month & Year.
  6) Deaths Happen against each day, month & Year.
# Label Encoding Model Buuilding & Application of Machine Learning Algorithms For Prediction & Forecasting:
Finding of R2_Score & Root Mean Square of model Using each of fallowing algorithm.
  1) Linear Regression Algorithm 
  2) Decision Tree Regressor
  3) Random Forest Regressor
  4) Support Vector REgressor
  5) XGBoost Regressor.
XGBoost Regressor is best for our model Which gives best result.
To increase the score W tried a Feature importance to all Above algorithms but no any change observed So Lets Keep All Features as it is.
We have make evaluation of R2_score & Root mean square by its graph.
Predictions Of Cases with graph using XGBoost Regressor Because it gives best result.
